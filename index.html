        <p>We ask that you take responsibility for your own actions during the event; take breaks, stretch your legs, think of your lower back, do a little self-care and be conscious of your consumption and how it affects you.

          Have awareness of your limits, practice patience, and pace yourself - there is time for everything.

        <p>Fandango is a community and we hope everyone will feel a sense of responsibility for each otherâ€™s comfort during our Spandau excursion. Mutual respect will ultimately lead to a better experience for all of us.
          <br><br>
          We want to provide a space where everyone feels safe to express their individuality. Please respect each otherâ€™s differences. Respect each otherâ€™s personal space both on and off the dancefloor. And respect pronouns, if youâ€™re unsure, please ask. Itâ€™s okay to make mistakes, as long as we acknowledge, apologize and do better next time.
          <br><br>
          Always ask for consent. Whether itâ€™s for potential sexual encounters, physical touch, or even a sensitive conversation topic, an open conversation will lead to fewer misunderstandings. Remember, we all have different boundaries.
          <br><br>
          We have a zero-tolerance policy for any homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, sexism, or racism. Any incidents of harassment or abuse of any kind will result in an immediate exit. Always contact our dedicated safe space team if you need any help, support, or guidance.</p>
